**Purpose** Silicon-based fast timing detectors have been widely used in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, space exploration
and other fields in recent years. However, silicon detectors often require complex low-temperature systems when operating in
irradiation environment, and their detection performance decreases with the increase in the irradiation dose. Compared with
silicon, silicon carbide (SiC) has a wider band gap, higher atomic displacement energy, saturated electron drift velocity and
thermal conductivity. Simultaneously, the low-gain avalanche detector avoids cross talk and high noise from high multiplication
due to its moderate gain, and thus can maintain a high detector signal without increasing noise.
**Aim** Thus, the 4H-SiC particle detector, especially the low-gain avalanche detector, has the potential to detect the minimal
ionizing particles under extreme irradiation and high-temperature environments.
**Method** In this work, the emphasis was placed on the design of a 4H-SiC low-gain avalanche detector (LGAD), especially
the epitaxial structure and technical process which play main roles. In addition, a simulation tool—RASER (RAdiation
SEmiconductoR)—was developed to simulate the performances including the electrical properties and time resolution of the
4H-SiC LGAD we proposed.
**Conclusion** The working voltage and gain effectiveness of the LGAD were verified by the simulation of electrical performances. The time resolution of the LGAD is (35.0 ± 0.2) ps under the electrical field of −800 V, which is better than that of
the 4H-SiC PIN detector.
